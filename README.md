# GooSigs

GooSigs are short (~1kB) signatures made using an RSA key that *don't reveal which RSA key made the signature.*
(GooSigs are named for the fact that they build on Groups of unknOwn Order.)

This document describes GooSigs informally, and documents libGooPy, a reference implementation.

[protocol.txt](protocol.txt) describes the mechanics of the protocol; [the paper](paper/) gives more details.


## Overview

A GooSig can be thought of either as a signature or as a succinct, non-interactive, publicly-verifiable
zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of an RSA secret key, where the verifier does not learn the
corresponding public key.

Viewed as a zero-knowledge proof scheme:

- A *Challenger* chooses an RSA public key *PK* and uses it to compute a challenge, *C*.
  (Informally, *C* does not reveal *PK*.)

- A *Prover* who knows the secret key corresponding to *PK* publishes a statement *T* and a proof *π*.
  (Informally, neither *T* nor *π* reveal *PK*.)

- A *Verifier* can then check that *π* is a correct proof corresponding to the challenge *C* and the statement *T*.

(In other words: the Challenger knows that *C* corresponds to *PK* (i.e., that PK is the Prover's
public key), but the Verifier does not learn *PK*.)

Viewed as a signature scheme:

- A *Signer* with GooSig public key (*C*,*T*) publishes a message *M* and signature *σ*.

- A *Verifier* checks that *σ* is a valid signature on *M* for the GooSig public key (*C*,*T*).

## libGooPy

This repository contains a reference implementation of GooSig called libGooPy. libGooPy is written
in Python, and aims to be compatible with CPython 2 and 3, PyPy, and PyPy3.

### running

You can run a few tests with

    python -m libGooPy [-a] [niters]

`-a` enables all tests (otherwise only end-to-end tests run). `niters` sets the number of test iterations; 16 is the default.

### interface

libGooPy has a relatively simple interface: the [`GooSigSigner` class](libGooPy/sign.py) implements
a signer, the [`GooSigVerifier` class](libGooPy/verify.py) a verifier.

[`__main__.py`](libGooPy/__main__.py) shows how this interface works:

- [First](libGooPy/__main__.py#L43), construct a `GooSigSigner` object and provide it with the factorization of the Signer's
  RSA modulus. You can optionally specify a group of unknown order when constructing; see below.

- [Next](libGooPy/__main__.py#L46), call `GooSigSigner.sign()` with the challenge `C1`, its opening `s`, and the message `msg`.
  The result is a signature.

- [Finally](libGooPy/__main__.py#L48-L49), construct a `GooSigVerifier` object and call `GooSigVerify.verify()` on the challenge
  and signature.

You can optionally construct [`RSAGroupOps` objects](libGooPy/group_ops.py) for the signer and
verifier (otherwise a default one will be constructed for you).
You must choose a group whose order is unknown to both the prover and the verifier!
For this purpose, [`defs.py`](libGooPy/defs.py)
provides three RSA moduli with (to our knowledge) unknown factorizations:
[the RSA-2048 challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-2048),
[the RSA-617 (2048-bit) challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-617),
and the 4096-bit modulus from the (now defunct)
[AOL Root CA 2 public key](https://ssl-tools.net/subjects/28ecf0993d30f9e4e607bef4f5c487f64a2a71a6)
(one of the oldest 4096-bit CA keys).

If you do not supply an `RSAGroupOps` object when constructing the `GooSigSigner` and
`GooSigVerifier` objects, the default is to use the RSA-2048 challenge.
